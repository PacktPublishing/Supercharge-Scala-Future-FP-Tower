Setup the Scala project
Step 1: Install Coursier
Coursier will allow you to install sbt, the Java Virtual Machine, Ammonite REPL, and other standard Scala tools.

See the setup command.

Step 2: Clone the project
The project is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/fp-tower/supercharge-scala-future. You will find there all the exercises, answers and tests.

To download the project, you will need to have git installed and then run either:

1| git clone git@github.com:fp-tower/supercharge-scala-future.git
1| git clone https://github.com/fp-tower/supercharge-scala-future.git


Step 3: IDE
The two most popular IDEs for Scala are Intellij and VS code.

If you have never used Intellij, I suggest using this bundle. It is a one-click installer for IntelliJ with the Scala plugin.
